# Employee Burnout Prediction AI Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for an AI project that analyzes an employee burnout dataset and makes predictions about burnout levels. The goal of this project is to help identify factors contributing to employee burnout and predict potential burnout cases to take timely preventive measures.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [ My Repository](https://github.com/likhithavarmaitte/AI/blob/main/employe_burnout.csv). It consists of various features related to employees' personal and professional life, along with their burnout levels, measured on a scale of 1 to 5. The dataset is available in the `data` directory and is split into training and testing sets.

## Notebooks

1. `20ne1a0461.ipynb`: This notebook explores the dataset, visualizes key insights, and performs descriptive statistics to understand the data.



## Source Code

The  `20ne1a0461.ipynb` file contains Python scripts that provide modularized functions for data preprocessing, model training, and utility functions used throughout the project.

## Trained Model

After training the model, the best-performing model is saved. This model can be used for making predictions on new data.
